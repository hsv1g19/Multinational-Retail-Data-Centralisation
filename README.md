# Multinational-Retail-Data-Centralisation

The context of this project is that, I work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe. Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. In an effort to become more data-driven, my organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location. My first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. I will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

The following milestones will outline the stepts I took when going through the project.
# Milestone 1: Set up the enviroment

- Used GitHub to track changes to my code and save them online in a GitHub repo

# Milestone 2: Extract and clean the data from the data sources

- Created three python scripts for data extraction, data cleaning and database connector each with its own class.
